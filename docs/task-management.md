```javascript
progressMetrics: {
    estimatedHours: 32,        // Initial estimate
    hoursSpent: 12,           // Actual time invested
    completionPercentage: 40   // Estimated completion
}
```

#### **Assignment History**
```javascript
assignmentHistory: [{
    assignedTo: 'Team Member Name',
    assignedDate: '2024-01-15',
    reason: 'Frontend expertise in React and responsive design'
}]
```

#### **Blocker History**
```javascript
blockerHistory: [{
    date: '2024-01-17',
    blocker: 'Waiting for payment provider API keys',
    impact: 'Cannot implement payment processing functionality',
    resolution: 'pending',
    escalatedTo: 'Product Manager'
}]
```
